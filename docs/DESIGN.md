# Design Rationale for IGDGQuantumTest

## Theoretical Background: Information-Geometric Duality Gravity (IGDG) Hypothesis

The Information-Geometric Duality Gravity (IGDG) hypothesis proposes a duality between information geometry and gravity. It suggests that the curvature of spacetime, which we perceive as gravity, may emerge from the underlying information geometry of quantum states. This project aims to explore and simulate some fundamental aspects of this hypothesis using quantum computing.

## Program Design

The IGDGQuantumTest project is structured to simulate basic effects that might arise from the IGDG hypothesis. The simulation is implemented in Q#, a quantum programming language, and the host program is written in C#.

### Quantum Simulation (Q#)

-   **IGDGOperations.qs**: Contains the core quantum operation `SimulateIGDG`. This operation currently serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the simulation flow. In future iterations, this operation will be expanded to perform actual quantum computations that model information-geometric effects relevant to gravity.
-   **Simulation.qs**: Includes additional simulation routines. Currently, it contains `RunSimulation` which is a placeholder for more complex simulation workflows.
-   **Utils.qs**: Provides utility functions, with `HelperFunction` as a placeholder for common computational needs within the quantum simulations.

### Host Program (C#)

-   **IGDGHost.csproj**: Defines the C# project, including dependencies on Quantum SDK and simulators, and references the Q# project.
-   **Driver.cs**: The main entry point of the program. It initializes a `QuantumSimulator`, invokes the `SimulateIGDG` operation, and displays the simulation result.

### Tests

-   **IGDGQuantumTest.Tests.csproj**: Defines the test project, referencing the Quantum SDK.
-   **QuantumTests.qs**: Contains Q# tests, including `TestSimulateIGDG` which is a placeholder test for quantum operations.
-   **HostTests.cs**: Includes C# tests, with `DummyHostTest` as a placeholder to ensure the test project is correctly set up for host-side tests.

### Documentation

-   **README.md**: Provides a project overview, build and run instructions.
-   **DESIGN.md**: This file, detailing the design rationale and theoretical background.

## Future Directions

This project is currently in its initial phase. Future development will focus on:

1.  **Implementing meaningful quantum simulations** in `IGDGOperations.qs` that reflect specific aspects of the IGDG hypothesis, such as simulating information potential fields or quantum entanglement effects in curved spacetime.
2.  **Expanding the test suite** to include more rigorous tests for both quantum operations and host program functionalities.
3.  **Adding more detailed documentation** and theoretical background to `DESIGN.md` as the project evolves.

This initial structure provides a foundation for exploring the IGDG hypothesis through quantum simulations and serves as a starting point for more advanced investigations.
